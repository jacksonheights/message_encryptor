# message_encryptor

Project done by f4Yy4Z

This Python script is designed to encrypt and decrypt messages using symmetric key cryptography provided by the Fernet module from the cryptography library. The script demonstrates how to securely generate a key, encrypt a plaintext message, and then decrypt the encrypted message back to its original form.

Key Points:
1. Symmetric Encryption: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, meaning the security of the encrypted data relies entirely on keeping this key secure.
2. Fernet Security: Fernet guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key, as it provides both encryption and authentication (via HMAC).
3. Ease of Use: The script is designed to be straightforward, illustrating the basic principles of symmetric encryption in Python using the cryptography library.
